It often has been argued that humans are unique among primates in their ability to reason abstractly and that young children are limited to 'concrete' reasoning, while only older children and adults can think relationally – meaning they compare the abstract relations among stimuli rather than just their concrete features. New studies are beginning to challenge those prior theories. Here, we show that, while humans exhibit more flexible and robust use of relational reasoning, monkeys can transition from concrete to relational reasoning with targeted training. This is important because it is a rare demonstration of flexible reasoning in a non-human primate, and suggests that monkeys’ strong inductive biases can be overcome with experience. Moreover it strongly implicates a shared cognitive foundation among primates, shaped by different developmental biases rather than a strict evolutionary divide. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experience and education critically shape human relational reasoning, as seen in adults from a culture in which schooling is rare and whose reasoning strategies vary with exposure to formal education. These findings challenge the idea of a unique or genetic basis for reasoning in humans, showing instead that reasoning is malleable in primates, including humans, and is cultivated through experience.
